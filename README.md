Phishing(Suspicious) Indicators:

3.	No official government formatting or signature
4.	Tries to tempt with “refund” money
Short Explanation:This is a fake government refund email pretending to be from the Income Tax Department. It tries to trick users into downloading a malicious file.
Step 2: Examine the Sender’s Email Address
Check if the sender’s email domain looks official.
	Genuine government emails end with .gov.in (e.g: helpdesk@incometax.gov.in)
	Here it’s @gov-refund.in, which is fake.
Explanation: Attackers use similar looking domains to fool people (this is called email spoofing).


Step 3: Check for Attachments or Links
There is an attachment named TaxRefundForm.zip.
Explanation: Phishing emails often include ZIP or EXE files that contain malware. Never open such files from unknown sources.
Step 4: Look for Urgent or Tempting Language
Phrases like “You are eligible for a refund” or “Please fill out the form to claim” create a sense of urgency or greed.
Explanation: Phishing relies on emotional manipulation like either scaring or exciting the victim so they act quickly.
Step 5: Analyze Email Formatting
Notice:
•	No official logo or digital signature
•	No contact number or official template
Explanation: Government agencies always use standard formats, seals, or e-signatures. Their emails don’t look casual like this one.
Step 6: Check Grammar and Structure
Even if the grammar looks okay here, many phishing emails contain:
•	Minor grammatical errors
•	Poor formatting
•	Generic greetings like “Dear Taxpayer” instead of your name
Explanation: Attackers often send mass emails, not personalized messages.
Step 7: Analyze Header (if it’s available)
If this was a real email file, you could:
•	Copy the email header
•	Go to MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer
•	Paste the header and check the real sender IP/domain
Explanation: This helps verify whether the email was truly sent from a government domain.
